<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE FLAGS THAT BROUGHT THE COLONISTS</h3>

<p>More than three hundred years ago a little
sailing vessel set out from Holland, crossed the
Atlantic Ocean, and followed down our coast
from Greenland. Its captain, Henry Hudson, was
in search of a quick and easy route to Asia, and
when he entered the mouth of the river that is
named for him, he hoped that he had found a
strait leading to the Asiatic coast. He was disappointed
in this, but the Indians welcomed
him, the mountains were rich in forests, and the
ground was fertile. "It is the most beautiful
land in all the world," declared the enthusiastic
navigator.</p>

<p>Henry Hudson was an Englishman, but he
sailed in the employ of the Dutch East India
Company, and soon the flag of this Company was
well known along the Hudson River. It was the
old flag of Holland, three horizontal stripes, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
orange, white, and blue, with the initials of the
Company on the white stripe. Hudson had not
found a new route to Asia, but he had opened the
way for the fur-trade. In a few years the Dutch
had established trading-posts as far north as
Albany. They had also founded a city which we
call "New York," but which they named "New
Amsterdam." So it was that in 1609 the Dutch
flag first came to the New World.</p>

<p>Nearly thirty years after the voyage of Henry
Hudson, a company of Swedes made a settlement
on the Delaware River. This had been planned
by the great Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden.
"That colony will be the jewel of my kingdom,"
he said; but the "Lion of the North" was slain
in battle, and his twelve-year-old daughter Christina
had become queen. That is why the loyal
Swedes named their little fortification Fort
Christiana, and over it they raised the flag of
their country, a blue banner with a yellow
cross.</p>

<p>In course of time the Swedes were overpowered
by the Dutch, and then the Dutch by
the English; so that before many years had
passed, the only flag that floated over the "Old
Thirteen" colonies was that of England. This
was brought across the sea by the settlers of
our first English colony, Jamestown, in Virginia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Moreover, they had the honor of sailing away
from England in all the glories of a brand-new
flag made in a brand-new design. The flag of
England had been white with a red upright
cross known as "St. George's Cross"; but a new
king, James I, had come to the throne, and the
flag as well as many other things had met with
a change. James was King of Scotland by birth,
and the Scotch flag was blue with the white
diagonal cross of St. Andrew. When James became
King of England, he united the two flags
by placing on a blue background the upright
cross of St. George over the diagonal cross of St.
Andrew; and he was so well pleased with the
result that he commanded every English vessel
to bear in its maintop this flag, "joined together
according to the form made by our own heralds,"
the King declared with satisfaction. It was the
custom at that time to call "ancient" whatever
was not perfectly new, and therefore the flag used
before James became king was spoken of as the
"ancient flag," while the new one became the
"King's Flag" or the "Union Jack." This change
was made in the very year when the grant for
Virginia was obtained, and therefore the little
company of settlers probably sailed for America
with the "King's Flag" in the maintop and the
"ancient flag" in the foretop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>On land, among the colonists, sometimes one
flag was floated and sometimes the other. In
Massachusetts the red cross of St. George seems
to have been much in use; but before long that
red cross began to hurt the consciences of the
Puritans most grievously. To them the cross
was the badge of the Roman Catholic Church.
Still, it was on the flag of their mother country,
the flag that floated over their forts and their
ships. The Puritan conscience was a stern master,
however, and when one day John Endicott
led the little company of Salem militia out for
a drill, and saw that cross hanging over the
governor's gate, the sight was more than he
could bear, and he&mdash;but Hawthorne has already
told the story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Endicott gazed around at the excited countenances
of the people, now full of his own spirit, and then
turned suddenly to the standard-bearer, who stood
close behind him.</p>

<p>"Officer, lower your banner!" said he.</p>

<p>The officer obeyed; and brandishing his sword,
Endicott thrust it through the cloth, and, with his
left hand, rent the red cross completely out of the
banner. He then waved the tattered ensign above his
head.</p>

<p>"Sacrilegious wretch!" cried the High Churchman
in the pillory, unable longer to restrain himself,
"thou hast rejected the symbol of our holy
religion!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>"Treason, treason!" roared the Royalist in the
stocks. "He hath defaced the King's banner!"</p>

<p>"Before God and man, I will avouch the deed,"
answered Endicott. "Beat a flourish, drummer!&mdash;shout,
soldiers and people!&mdash;in honor of the ensign
of New England. Neither Pope nor Tyrant hath
part in it now!"</p>

<p>With a cry of triumph the people gave their sanction
to one of the boldest exploits which our history
records.</p></div>

<p>Endicott was one of the court assistants, but
he was now removed from his position and forbidden
to hold any public office for one year. He
was fortunate in being permitted to retain his
head.</p>

<p>Endicott had been punished, but the Puritan
conscience was not yet at rest, and now many of
the militia declared that they did not think it
right to march under the cross. The whole militia
could not well be punished, and the commissioners
for military affairs were as doubtful
as the honest militia men about what should be
done. "We will leave it to the next General
Court to decide," they said, "and in the meantime
no flags shall be used anywhere."</p>

<p>This seemed a comfortable way to settle the
question, but unluckily there was a fort on Castle
Island at the entrance to Boston Harbor, and
when an English vessel came sailing in, its captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
refused to pay any attention to a fort without
a flag. Then the officer in command rose to
his dignity and made the ship&mdash;maybe with the
aid of a ball across her bows&mdash;strike her colors.
The captain complained to the authorities that
the commandant of this flagless fort had insulted
his flag and his country. The authorities were
just a bit alarmed. To insult a flag and a country
was a serious matter. "What shall we do to
make amends?" they queried. "Let the officer
who proffered the insult come on board of my
vessel and say in the presence of the ship's company
that he was in fault," replied the captain.
This was done, and the sky cleared.</p>

<p>But the troubles of the colonists were by no
means over. The mate of another vessel declared
with considerable emphasis that these
people were all rebels and traitors to the King.
Surely the thought of such a report as this
going back to England from a tiny colony clinging
to the edge of the continent was enough to
alarm the boldest. Discussions were held, and
Dr. John Cotton was appealed to.</p>

<p>A canny man was this Dr. John Cotton, and
he decided that inasmuch as the fort belonged
to the King, it was proper that it should display
the King's Flag, whatever it might be,&mdash;"while
vessels are passing," he added shrewdly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
but that, as for the militia, each company
might have its own colors, and not one of
them need bear a cross. So the great tempest
passed by.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE PINE-TREE FLAG AND OTHERS</h3>

<p>In some of the colonies at least, the people must
have led a rather somber life, with little pleasure,
much hard work, and much discomfort; but they
fairly reveled in flags. The Indians in their warfare
preferred to hide behind trees rather than to
flourish banners, and the white men soon learned
to follow their example. Nevertheless, it always
seemed to the minds of the colonists a little
irregular and out of place not to carry a flag of
some sort when they were setting out on an expedition.</p>

<p>Probably we do not know one in twenty of all
the designs for banners that entered the fertile
minds of these colonists, but they were so numerous
that if they had all been displayed at the
same time, they would have almost hidden the
settlements. Not all colonists were as afraid of
a cross as were the good folk of Salem. In Newbury,
Massachusetts, a certain company of foot
rejoiced in a flag of vivid green. In the upper
corner next the staff was a square of white containing
a red cross. The kindly councilor, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
had ordered the flag to be made in England
"with all convenient speed," evidently had some
sense of humor, for he wrote at the end of his
letter to the company, "The number of bullets
to be put into your colors for distinction may be
left out at present without damage in the making
of them." Another flag, belonging to a company
of Massachusetts cavalry, seems to have
been something quite out of the common, for it
was of damask and silk and adorned with silver
fringe. A real artist must have used his brush
upon it, for the bill read, "For painting in oyle on
both sides a Cornett on rich crimson damask,
with a hand and sword and invelloped with a
scarfe about the arms of gold, black and silver";
and for all that gorgeousness, generously painted
"on both sides," the charge was the moderate one
of &pound;5 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> This was made for what was known
as the "Three County Troop," composed of cavalry
from Essex, Middlesex, and Suffolk Counties
in Massachusetts, and was probably used in
King Philip's War.</p>

<p>Now, wherever a discoverer planted the sole
of his foot, he took possession for his sovereign of
all the land in sight and all the land which joined
that land. Naturally, the claims of the colonies
soon conflicted. The good folk of New England
made an alliance to defend themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
against the Dutch, Swedes, and French. They
managed to be good allies for forty years without
a flag. Then came one brilliant enough to
make up for the delay, and sent to them across
the sea by no less a man than King James II himself.
This was of white with a St. George's cross of
red. In the center of the cross was a golden crown
and under it the King's monogram in black. A
few years later matters in England had changed.
King James II had proved to be a very poor sort
of sovereign, and it was made clear to him that
for his health and comfort&mdash;possibly for his head&mdash;it
would be wise for him to leave the country.
This he did in alarm and at full speed, tossing
the royal seal into the Thames on his way. It
is small wonder that New Englanders preferred
a new flag. The only marvel is that they waited
so long a time before getting it. When it was
finally chosen, it proved to be red with a white
canton or union cut by a red St. George's cross
into four squares. In one of these squares was the
representation of a pine tree. This representation
can hardly have been a work of art, for one
historian says unkindly of it that it "no more resembled
a pine tree than a cabbage." Evidently
the brave colonists were not artists. Nevertheless,
even if the good folk of Massachusetts could
not draw a pine tree, they were fond of it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
their General Court decreed that it should be
stamped upon the coins minted in that colony.
Now it was the right of the King to coin money,
and when Charles II heard that the ambitious
colonists were making it for themselves, he was
not pleased. "But it is only for their own use,"
said a courtier who favored the colonies, and
taking a New England coin from his pocket, he
showed it to the King. "What tree is that?"
demanded the aggrieved monarch. "That," said
the quick-witted courtier, "is the royal oak which
saved Your Majesty's life." "Well, well," said
the King, "those colonists are not so bad after
all. They're a parcel of honest dogs!" Perhaps
they were, even if their likenesses of pine trees
could not be distinguished from cabbages and
oaks. Hawthorne's story, "The Pine-Tree Shillings,"
is written about this inartistic coinage.</p>

<p>So the story of the flags went on. Besides the
English flag every little company of militia had
its standard. One flag bore a hemisphere in the
corner in place of a pine tree, and another bore
nothing but a tree. The colonists did not trouble
themselves about being artistic or choosing colors
of any special significance; if the ground of the
flag was of one color and the cross or whatever
other figure was chosen was of another, they
were satisfied. Charleston, South Carolina, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
a specially elegant flag&mdash;blue with a silver crescent&mdash;to
use on "dress-up" days. After a time
even the Indians were sometimes furnished with
flags, for one kindly governor gave them a Union
Jack as a protection. He presented them also with
a red flag to indicate war and a white one as a
sign of peace; and probably the fortunate Indians
felt with all this magnificence quite like
white folk.</p>

<p>In 1745, when that remarkable expedition
of New Englanders&mdash;which had "a lawyer for
contriver, a merchant for general, and farmers,
fishermen, and mechanics for soldiers"&mdash;set
off to capture Louisburg from the French, they
sailed proudly away under a flag whereon was
written in Latin, "Never despair, for Christ is
our leader." It was on this same expedition that
a new flag was hoisted, the like of which was
never seen before. An officer discovered that a
battery on the shore of the harbor was apparently
vacant. There was no flag flying from the
staff and no smoke rising from the chimney. It
looked as if that battery might be taken easily.
On the other hand it was also quite possible
that this was a ruse and was meant to decoy
the colonists within. The officer concluded to
run the risk&mdash;of losing the life of some one else.
Holding up a bottle of brandy before the thirsty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
gaze of an Indian, he said, "If I give you this,
will you creep in at that embrasure and open the
gate?" The red man grunted assent, crept in,
and opened the gate. Then the officer and
twelve men took possession. Soon a message
went from the officer to his general as follows:
"May it please your honor to be informed that
by the grace of God and the courage of thirteen
men, I entered the royal battery about nine
o'clock, and am awaiting for a reinforcement
and a flag." Sometimes the colonists were wanting
in the grace of patience, and this was one of
the occasions. A soldier, tired of delay, decided
that, although he could not provide reinforcements,
he could provide a flag; so up the staff
he clambered with a red coat in his teeth. He
nailed it to the top of the staff, and it swung
out in the wind, much to the alarm of the citizens,
who sent one hundred men in boats to recapture
the battery. The hundred men fired, but
the brave little company kept them from landing
and held their position till the general could
send help.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>LIBERTY AND LIBERTY POLES</h3>

<p>After the middle of the eighteenth century
there was much talk among the colonies of liberty.
It is possible that not all the people were
quite clear in their minds what that "liberty"
might mean; but whatever it was, they wanted it.
England required nothing more of her colonies
than other nations required of theirs. The colonies
asked nothing of England that would not be
granted to-day as a matter of course. The difficulty
was that the mother country was living
in the eighteenth century, while the colonists
were looking forward into the nineteenth. A demand
for liberty was in the air. The pole on
which a flag was hung was not called a flag pole,
but a liberty pole.</p>

<p>Most of the flags on these liberty poles bore
mottoes, many of them decidedly bold and defiant.
When the Stamp Act was passed, the
wrath of the people rose, and now they knew
exactly what they wanted&mdash;"No taxation
without representation." The stamped paper
brought to South Carolina was carefully stowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
away in a fort. Thereupon three volunteer companies
from Charleston took possession of the
fort, ran up a blue flag marked with three white
crescents, and destroyed the paper. New York's
flag had one word only, but that one word was
"Liberty." Portsmouth, New Hampshire, had
a banner inscribed "Liberty, Property, and
no Stamps." In Newburyport, Massachusetts,
there was a regular patrol of men armed with
stout sticks. "What do you say, stamps or no
stamps?" they demanded of every stranger, and
if he had a liking for a whole skin, he replied emphatically,
"No stamps." One wary newcomer
replied courteously, "I am what you are," and
was uproariously cheered.</p>

<p>In going from one colony to another, it was
not uncommon for a man to get a passport from
the sons of Liberty to attest to his standing as a
"Liberty man." When the stamps made their
first appearance, Boston tolled her church bells
and put her flags at half-mast. Indeed, a new
sort of flag appeared in the shape of an effigy of
Oliver, the stamp distributor, swinging from the
bough of a great elm which stood by the main
entrance to town. The Chief Justice ordered
this image to be removed. "Certainly," replied
the people politely, "we will take it down ourselves
this very evening." So they did, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
laid it upon a bier and marched in a long <a name="processsion" id="processsion"></a> procession
through the old State House. Here, in
the Council Chamber, the Governor and his
Council were deliberating. Shouts came up from
below, "Liberty, Property, and no Stamps!" and
"Death to the man who offers a piece of stamped
paper to sell!" "Beat an alarm," the Chief
Justice commanded the colonel of the militia.
"But I cannot," replied the colonel, "my drummers
are in the mob." The procession marched
on, burned the effigy in front of the distributor's
house, gave three rousing cheers, and went home.
In New York, when the rumor spread that a ship
laden with stamps was approaching, all the vessels
in the harbor put their colors at half-mast.</p>

<p>When every distributor of stamps had resigned
his office, there was another outburst of
banners. Charleston, South Carolina, hoisted a
liberty flag, surmounted by a branch of laurel.
The tree in Boston on which the effigy of the
stamp distributor had been hung had become an
important member of colonial society. It had
been formally named the "Liberty Tree," and
the ground under it was called "Liberty Hall."
Banners were often swung from its branches, and
notices were nailed to its trunk. Fastened firmly
to the trunk was a tall liberty pole, and whenever
any one caught a glimpse of a red flag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
waving from the top of the pole, he knew that the
Sons of Liberty were to hold a meeting. When
the Stamp Act was repealed, the Liberty Tree was
the very center of rejoicing. At one o'clock in
the morning, the church bell nearest it was rung
joyfully. At the first rays of dawn, the houses
about it, even the steeple of the church, all blossomed
out with banners, and at night the tree
itself was aglow with lanterns. In New York
a liberty pole was set up with a splendid new
flag on which was inscribed, "The King, Pitt,
and Liberty." It almost seemed as if "liberty"
meant having whatever sort of flag might suit
one's whim.</p>

<p>This New York pole had rather a hard time.
British soldiers cut it down twice, and when a
third pole was raised, sheathed with iron around
its base, they managed to cut that down also, although
it bore the legend, "To His Most Gracious
Majesty George III, Mr. Pitt, and Liberty."
The city authorities would not risk planting another
pole on city land, and thereupon the Sons
of Liberty bought a piece of land for themselves,
and marched up in brilliant procession; first a
full band, playing with all its might, then six
horses, made gorgeous with bright ribbons,
drawing from the shipyard a fine new pole,
sheathed in iron two thirds of its length. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
escorted by the Sons of Liberty in full numbers.
Three flags floated over the little procession, but
their mottoes were not so impressively loyal as
the earlier ones. These read, "Liberty and Property."
Nevertheless, "liberty" did not yet mean
separation from the mother country; it meant
only freedom in making some of their own laws;
and what was known as the "Union Flag" did
not refer to any union of the colonies, but rather
to the union of Scotland and England. This
flag, the regular flag of England, was red, with
the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew on a
blue field forming the Jack.</p>

<p>Once, however, more than twenty years before
the Revolutionary War, there had been some talk
of a union of colonies, beginning with the suggestions
of the most far-sighted man in America,
Benjamin Franklin. In 1754, when war between
France and England was on the point of breaking
out, there was a meeting at Albany of delegates
from several colonies. They had come to see if
they could make sure of the aid of the Six Nations
of Indian tribes; and here the sagacious
Franklin brought forward his plan for a union.
His scheme was for the colonies to elect a Grand
Council, which should meet every year in Philadelphia,
to levy taxes, enlist soldiers, plan for defense,
and, in short, to attend to whatever concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
all the colonies. Whatever affected them
separately was to be managed by the colony interested.
This Council was to have much the
same powers as our Congress of to-day; but there
must be a place in the scheme for the King,
of course; so Franklin proposed that the King
should appoint a president who should have the
right to veto the acts of the Grand Council. This
was the "Albany Plan." Franklin was much
in earnest about the matter, and had a cut made
for the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i> picturing a rather
unpleasant device, a snake sliced uncomfortably
into ten parts, the head marked "NE," for
New England, and each of the other pieces with
the initials of some one of the other nine colonies.
With the motto, "Unite or die," this work of
art appeared for a number of issues at the head
of the <i>Gazette</i>; but many years passed before
the colonies began to make any practical use of
the wisdom of Franklin in 1754.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE LAND OF MANY FLAGS</h3>

<p>When Paul Revere galloped through the villages
of Middlesex, calling "for the country folk
to be up and to arm," there was not much spare
time for collecting flags, and probably when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">"The farmers gave them ball for ball,</p>
<p>From behind each fence and farmyard wall,"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>they did not trouble themselves to flourish a
flag before they shot. Yet, if we may trust a
family tradition, at least one flag waved over the
plucky farmers. It seems that for a long while
one member or another of the Page family of
Bedford had been accustomed to carrying the
colors of the militia, and therefore when the
alarm was given and Nathaniel Page started for
Concord, it was as natural for him to seize his
flag as his gun. Moreover, this story has the
bunting to back it up, for the Bedford flag remained
in the Page family until presented to the
town a century after the close of the war. It is
rather a pity that it did not come a little sooner,
for an old lady of Page descent confessed that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
her giddy girlhood she had irreverently ripped
off the silver fringe to make trimming for her
ball dress.</p>

<p>The Revolution was fairly on, and two months
later, the battle of Bunker Hill was fought.
Possibly the colonists thought of spades rather
than standards when they were throwing up the
fortifications, and yet I fancy that to these flag-loving
fighters a battle without a banner would
have seemed like an undignified riot. Some
writers say positively that no flag was to be seen&mdash;rather
a difficult statement to prove. The
daughter of one of the soldiers declared that
her father helped hoist the standard known as
the "New England Flag." "He called it a 'noble
flag,'" she said. "It was blue with the red cross
of St. George in a white corner, and in one section
was a pine tree." The artist Trumbull, who
painted the picture of this battle now in the
Capitol at Washington, made the flag red instead
of blue, but both were familiar colonial flags, and
there is no reason why both should not have
waved over the famous hill. Tradition says
that one flag bore the motto, "Come if you
dare." General Gage is said to have had difficulty
in reading it, but maybe that was because
of its audacity. Some verses written soon after
the battle say that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"Columbia's troops are seen in dread array,</p>
<p>And waving streamers in the air display";&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>but, unluckily, the poet forgot to mention the
color of those "waving streamers." In Savannah,
after the battle, but before any news of it
could have arrived, the independent Georgians
hoisted a Union flag and suggestively placed two
pieces of artillery directly under it. New York
chose a white flag with a black beaver thereon.
Rhode Island had also a white flag, but with a
blue anchor instead of a beaver, and a blue canton
with thirteen white stars. Her motto was
"Hope." Connecticut meant that there should
be no mistake in the whereabouts of her regiments,
for she gave them flags of solid color: to
the first, yellow; the second, blue; the third,
scarlet; and so on with crimson, white, azure,
another shade of blue, and orange. For a motto
Connecticut chose "Qui transtulit sustinet";
that is, "He who brought us here sustains us."
Massachusetts chose for her motto "An Appeal
to Heaven." Charleston had a blue flag with a
white crescent in the upper corner next to the
staff and inscribed upon her banner the daring
words, "Liberty or Death." Later she adopted
a rattlesnake flag. Her troops wore blue and had
silver crescents on the front of their caps, inscribed
with the same motto. It is small wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
that timid folk were alarmed and whispered to
one another, "That is going too far; it looks like
a declaration of war." This blue and silver flag
was planned by Colonel Moultrie. When Fort
Moultrie&mdash;which received this name because of
his brave defense&mdash;was shelled the following
year, the anxious folk in the town watched with
troubled faces, for it was doubtful whether the
little fort with its scant supply of ammunition
could sustain the attack. Suddenly the crescent
flag fell from its staff. A groan ran through the
crowd&mdash;Colonel Moultrie had struck his flag!
"Forward!" cried one among them, and they
marched to the water's edge to fight for their
homes. Within the little fort one William Jasper,
a sergeant, saw that a ball had cut down the flag
and it had fallen over the rampart. "Colonel,"
he said to his commander, "don't let us fight
without a flag." "What can you do?" demanded
Colonel Moultrie, "the staff is broken." Sergeant
Jasper was a man of few words and many
deeds. He leaped through an embrasure, walked
the whole length of the fort in a heavy fire from
the ships, caught up the flag, brought it safely
back, and fastened it to a sponge-staff. Then,
in the midst of cheers,&mdash;in which I fancy the
British also joined,&mdash;he fastened the rescued
banner upon the bastion. The following day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Governor came to the fort, asked for Sergeant
Jasper, presented him with his own sword, and
gave him hearty thanks in behalf of his country.
Then he said, "I will gladly give you a lieutenant's
commission," but the honest man refused.
"I am only a sergeant," he said. "I don't
know how to read or write, and I am not fit to
keep company with officers." Colonel Moultrie
then gave him a roving commission, and he often
made some little trip with half a dozen men and
returned with a band of prisoners before any
one realized that he had gone. The wife of Major
Elliot presented the regiment with a pair of
beautiful silken colors, which were afterwards
carried in the assault upon Savannah. The
standard-bearers were shot down; another man
seized them, but he was also shot; then Sergeant
Jasper caught them and fastened them on the
parapet, when he too was fatally wounded by
a ball. "Tell Mrs. Elliot," he said, "that I lost
my life supporting the colors she gave to our
regiment." A tablet in honor of the brave sergeant
was long ago placed in Savannah.</p>

<p>The rattlesnake as an emblem seems to have
been somewhat of a favorite among the colonists.
Besides Franklin's snake of the many initials&mdash;which,
indeed, might have stood, or coiled, for
any sort of serpent&mdash;there was the one borne by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Patrick Henry's men when they forced the
Governor of Virginia to pay for the powder which
he had carried away from the colonial magazine.
Then, too, there was a third variety of snake,
the one that stretched itself across a colonial
naval flag and proclaimed&mdash;from the top of the
mast&mdash;"Don't tread on me." On another flag
the rattlesnake appeared coiled in the roots of
a pine tree and ready to strike. The Culpeper
Minute Men of Virginia had a coiled snake on
their flag. In the winter of 1775 there appeared in
the <i>Pennsylvania Journal</i> an article setting forth
the propriety of choosing the rattlesnake to
represent America. The style of the article and
its keenness are like Franklin, but there is no
proof that he was its author. Whoever did write
it notes that the "rattler" is peculiar to America;
that the brightness of its eyes and their lack
of lids fit it to be an emblem of vigilance. It never
begins an attack and never surrenders, never
wounds till it has given warning. The writer had
counted the rattles on the naval flag, and found
them to be exactly thirteen, the number of the
colonies. He had also noted that the rattles were
independent of one another, and yet most firmly
united; and that while one rattle alone is incapable
of producing any sound, the ringing of
the thirteen together is sufficient to alarm the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
boldest man living. Whether Franklin wrote this
or not, let us at least be thankful that these arguments
did not prevail, and that on the flag of the
United States there are stars and not serpents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>WHEN WASHINGTON WENT TO CAMBRIDGE</h3>

<p>Washington, chosen commander-in-chief, set
out on June 21, 1775, on his eleven-days' ride
to Boston. From Philadelphia to New York he
was escorted by the Philadelphia Light Horse
Troop. It was an escort worth having. Their
uniform was "a dark brown short coat, faced and
lined with white; high-topped boots; round black
hat, bound with silver cord; a buck's tail, saddlecloths
brown edged with white, and the letters
'L.H.' worked on them. Their arms were a carbine,
a pair of pistols and holsters; a horseman's
sword; white belts for the sword and carbine."
Officers of the militia, the Massachusetts members
of the Continental Congress, and many
others were also of the company. The horses
pranced, the music played, and the cavalcade
started from the Quaker City for the war that
was to make the country free. The flag that was
borne before them is now carefully preserved
between two heavy plates of glass, and is kept
in the Troop's armory, in a fireproof safe made
expressly for that purpose. The banner is only
forty inches long, but its richness makes up for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
its lack of size. It is of yellow silk with heavy
silver fringe. Around the flag is a graceful running
vine. The crest is a horse's head. In the
center are figures representing Fame and Liberty.
Under them is the motto, "For these we
strive." Some verses written many years ago
say of this flag:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"For these we strive; what brighter name</p>
<p class="i2">Can man achieve or beauty see,</p>
<p>Than worth to share his country's FAME,</p>
<p class="i2">Or perish for her LIBERTY?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is a precious relic for its associations, and still
more precious because the canton is made of
thirteen stripes, blue and silver alternating.
Apparently these stand for the thirteen colonies,
and so far as is known, this was the first
time that the colonies were represented, as on
our flag of to-day, by thirteen stripes.</p>

<p>Before Washington and his escort reached
New York, couriers reported the battle of Bunker
Hill. Washington pushed on, and July 2, he had
his first glimpse of his forces. It must have been
a discouraging glimpse. A few wore uniforms,
but most of the men had come in "what they
had." The men of a few companies were provided
with tents, others slept in the halls of Harvard
College, in the pews of the Episcopal Church,
or in private houses. Still others had built their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
own huts, of boards, turf, sailcloth, stones, or
brush. Powder and artillery were scanty, and
the commander-in-chief had been furnished with
no money. Perhaps this was not so remarkable,
however, for the members of the Continental
Congress had no power to collect taxes, and in
reality had no control over any money except
what was in their own pockets. Officers and men
chatted together as freely as if in their own
homes; and if an order did not impress a man as
being wise, he sometimes stopped and patiently
explained to the officer why he thought another
course was better.</p>

<p>Twelve of the most independent companies,
and yet the most vigilant and best disciplined of
all, were composed of backwoodsmen who had
come on foot from four to eight hundred miles.
A little later, five Indians came to Cambridge
to help fight for liberty. They were welcomed
cordially and entered the service. It is probable
that every little company marched to Cambridge
under its own colors, but of course there
was no flag representing the colonies as a whole.</p>

<p>Immediately after the battle of Bunker Hill,
Major-General Israel Putnam took up his stand
on Prospect Hill. One month later he called together
all the troops under his command, and
read them the statement issued by the Continental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Congress which declared just why the
colonies had had recourse to arms. The chaplain
made an address and a prayer, at the end of
which the troops responded, "Amen." Then
there was unfurled a scarlet standard, which
it is said John Hancock had just presented to
General Putnam and his men in recognition of
their bravery at Bunker Hill. Tradition says this
standard bore on one side the motto of Connecticut,
"Qui transtulit sustinet," and on the other
a pine tree and the motto of Massachusetts,
"An Appeal to Heaven."</p>

<p>It is a little strange that the Massachusetts
colonists did not put the likeness of an elm on
any of their banners, for so much of their history
was associated with the "Liberty Elm." A
few flags on both land and sea were inscribed
"Liberty Tree," but no exercise of the imagination
can make the pictured tree look in the least
like an elm. Under the Liberty Elm of Boston
the meetings of the Sons of Liberty were held,
as has been said, and here it was that the resolutions
were adopted which resulted in dropping
three hundred and forty chests of tea into Boston
Harbor. The Liberty Tree of Charleston, South
Carolina, was a beautiful live-oak. It is said
that under this tree Christopher Gadsden, even
before the Stamp Act, ventured to speak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
possible independence of the colonies. Here, as in
Boston, the patriots came together to discuss the
way to liberty, and with hand clasped in hand
solemnly promised that when the hour for resistence
should come, they would not be found
unready. There is something refreshing in the
thought of all the free, open-air discussion that
went on under the Liberty Trees. There was no
stifling of thought in closed rooms with bolted
doors. Every new idea, daring as it might be,
was blown upon by the free winds of heaven.
Naturally, the British commanders hated these
trees and thoroughly enjoyed destroying them
whenever they had opportunity. The Boston
tree was cut down even before the battle of Lexington.
In 1780 Sir Henry Clinton cut down the
live-oak in Charleston, piled its severed branches
over the stump, and set fire to them. Even the
iron-girt Liberty Pole of New York was cut
down by the red coats in 1776. It is little wonder
that Thomas Paine's poem on the "Liberty
Tree" was so roundly applauded. This closes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"But hear, O ye swains,&mdash;'tis a tale most profane,</p>
<p class="i2">How all the tyrannical powers,</p>
<p>Kings, Commons, and Lords, are uniting amain,</p>
<p class="i2">To cut down this guardian of ours.</p>
<p>From the East to the West, blow the trumpet to arms,</p>
<p class="i2">Through the land let the sound of it flee,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE "GRAND UNION FLAG"</h3>

<p>During the summer following the battle of
Bunker Hill, the colonies had a congress without
authority, a commander-in-chief without
money, and an army without discipline, equipments,
or flag&mdash;or rather, with so many flags
that they must have had little significance except
to the respective groups of men who had
marched under each. Before Christmas a flag
was designed and made, but how, where, and
by whom is not known. Neither Washington nor
Franklin gives any information, and the <i>Journal</i>
of Congress says nothing about its designer or
maker. It is true that a committee of three,&mdash;all
signers of the Declaration of Independence
a few months later,&mdash;Benjamin Franklin, of
Pennsylvania, Benjamin Harrison, of Virginia,
whose son Benjamin was afterwards to become
President of the United States, and Thomas
Lynch, of South Carolina, were sent by Congress
to Cambridge, to discuss with Washington
and others many necessary questions, but there
is no proof that the design of a flag was among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
them. The flag, however, was made. This was
what is known as the "Grand Union Flag."
The British flag, red with a blue union, marked
by the upright cross of St. George and the diagonal
cross of St. Andrew, was known as the
"Union Flag," because it typified, as has been
said before, the union of England and Scotland.
The new flag retained the blue union with its
two crosses, but instead of a red field it had red
and white stripes. These thirteen stripes represented
the thirteen colonies; the blue union suggested
that the colonies still clung to the mother
country.</p>

<p>Where the idea of using stripes came from is a
question that has never been solved. The Philadelphia
Troop had thirteen stripes on their banner,
but they were blue and white. Washington's
coat of arms contained red and white
stripes; but Washington was too modest a man
to suggest using his own family arms, and as to
any one's suggesting it for him, it must be remembered
that he was not yet the revered
"Father of his Country," but simply a Virginia
planter of forty-three years who had been successful
in fighting the Indians, and who, because
of his good judgment and uprightness of character,
had been made a member of the Virginia
Legislature and then of the Continental Congress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
The flag of the Netherlands&mdash;but chosen thirty
years after the Pilgrims left that country for
America&mdash;was red, white, and blue, in three
horizontal stripes. The ensign of the English
East India Company was a flag of thirteen horizontal
red and white stripes with a white canton
containing a red St. George's Cross; but there is
no reason to suppose that this inspired the flag
of the colonies. Bunting was scarce and Franklin
was always a thrifty soul. If that committee of
three did design the flag, it is not at all unlikely
that Franklin suggested utilizing the standards
they already had, and changing their character
by stitching on white stripes. To deface the flag
of Britain was a serious offense, and maybe it
was thought just as well that the name of the
originator of this "Grand Union" should not be
on record. The flag was first raised on the 1st
of January, 1776, in what is now Somerville,
on Prospect Hill, and was saluted with thirteen
guns and thirteen rousing cheers. It was seen by
the British troops in Boston, and for some reason
they took it as a sign of submission brought
about by the King's hostile proclamation, which
they supposed had been read in Cambridge.
Washington wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Before the proclamation came to hand, we had
hoisted the Union Flag in compliment to the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Colonies. But, behold, it was received in Boston as a
token of the deep impression the speech had made
upon us, and as a signal of submission. By this time,
I presume, they begin to think it strange that we have
not made a formal surrender of our lines.</p></div>

<p>The colonists had adopted a flag, but all sorts
of colors continued to be borne on both sea and
land. On the sea the favorite seems to have
been a white flag displaying a green pine tree.
One year after the battle of Lexington, Massachusetts
formally decreed that this flag should
be used on her vessels, and that their officers
should wear a green and white uniform. Even
two years later than this, the Pine-Tree Flag
was borne by floating batteries on the Delaware
River. Sometimes the British ran up an American
flag to deceive the colonial vessels, and
sometimes the colonists ran up a flag made of
horizontal red and white stripes to persuade the
British that it was one of their own signal flags.
Sometimes rattlesnake flags were used.</p>

<p>Congress ordered the building of war vessels
as promptly as possible, five cruisers first of all.
The Alfred, on which John Paul Jones was lieutenant,
became the flagship of Commander-in-Chief
Esek Hopkins. This vessel was of English
build and had been employed in commerce for
nine or ten years, making two voyages to the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Ocean during that time. She had space for
two hundred and twenty men, and had sixteen
guns, carried for the benefit of pirates. She had
been put in full repair and had now become a
frigate of twenty-eight guns. Such was the first
vessel of the Continental Navy. An old account
of the embarkation of Commodore Hopkins at
Philadelphia says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Alfred was anchored at the foot of Walnut
Street. On a brilliant morning early in February,
1776, gay streamers were seen floating from every
masthead and spar on the river. At nine o'clock a full-manned
barge threaded its way among the floating
ice to the Alfred, bearing the commodore, who had
chosen that vessel for his flagship. He was greeted
with thunders of artillery and the shouts of the multitude.</p></div>

<p>When he stepped on board the deck of the
Alfred, Captain Saltonstall gave a signal, and
Lieutenant Jones hoisted a new flag prepared for
the occasion. It is believed to have displayed a
union with thirteen stripes crossed by a rattlesnake
in some position, with the ominous motto,
"Don't tread on me." When the flag reached
the mast-head, the crowds cheered and the guns
fired a salute,&mdash;as well they might, for this was
the first ensign ever flung to the breeze on an
American man-of-war. Paul Jones appreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the honor of raising it, but he was no admirer of
the rattlesnake flag. In his journal he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was always at loss to know by what queer fancy
or by whose notion that device was first adopted. For
my own part, I never could see how or why a venomous
serpent could be the combatant emblem of a
brave and honest folk fighting to be free. Of course I
had no choice but to break the pennant as it was given
to me. But I always abhorred the device.</p></div>

<p>Three weeks after the Alfred was put in commission,
the little fleet sailed away from Philadelphia
amid the cheers of thousands of people.
One of the eye-witnesses said that the ships wore
the Union Flag with thirteen stripes in the field.
Of the admiral's flag an English writer said, "We
learn that the vessels bearing this flag have a
sort of commission from a society of people at
Philadelphia, calling themselves the continental
congress." Scornfully as he spoke of Congress,
there is at least one record of which it may
be proud. Franklin, under its authority, issued
letters of marque with a lavish hand, but, hard-pressed
as the colonists were, he bade John Paul
Jones "not to burn defenseless towns on the
British coast except in case of military necessity;
and in such cases he was to give notice, so that
the women and children with the sick and aged
inhabitants might be removed betimes." Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
he bade all American cruisers if they
chanced to meet Captain Cook, the great English
explorer of that day, to "forget the temporary
quarrel in which they were fighting and not
merely suffer him to pass unmolested, but offer
him every aid and service in their power."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST UNITED STATES FLAG</h3>

<p>The "society of people at Philadelphia calling
themselves the continental congress" had had,
so far as records go, nothing to do with choosing
any flag. The "Grand Union" unfurled at
Cambridge was regarded as symbolizing the
union of colonies, but no one knows who designed
it or chose it. To alter the design of our flag
to-day would be a very serious matter, but the
colonies were so accustomed to the making of
flags according to the whim of some militia
company or some sea captain that the appearance
of a new design, especially one so slightly
changed from the familiar flag of the mother
country, cannot have created any great sensation.
Moreover, flags were not for sale at department
stores; they had to be ordered, and in this
time of war, bunting was not easy to procure.
Flag-makers were few, and many a captain
sailed away with a flag manufactured by his
wife's own unaccustomed hands.</p>

<p>July 4, 1776, less than fifteen months after the
battle of Lexington, it was declared in Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
"That these united colonies are, and of right
ought to be, free and independent states." June
14, 1777, the following resolution was adopted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the flag of the thirteen United States
be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the
union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing
a new constellation.</p></div>

<p>So much for the share that Congress had in the
flag. The story of the making of the first flag with
stars and stripes is as follows. Betsy Ross, or, to
speak more respectfully, Mrs. Elizabeth Griscom
Ross, lived on Arch Street, Philadelphia, in a
tiny house of two stories and an attic. She was
called the most skillful needlewoman in the city,
and there is a tradition that before Washington
became commander-in-chief, she embroidered
ruffles for his shirts&mdash;quite an important branch
of fine sewing in those days. Whether she ever
embroidered the great man's ruffles or not, it is
said that, whenever folk wanted any especially
fine work done, they always went to "Betsy
Ross." She could do more than sew, for she could
draw freehand the complicated patterns that
were used in quilting, the supreme proof of artistic
ability in the household. One day three gentlemen
entered her house through its humble doorway.
One was her uncle by marriage, Colonel
Ross; one is thought to have been Robert Morris;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
one was General Washington. The commander-in-chief
told her that they had come from Congress
to ask her if she could make a flag. "I
don't know," she replied, "but I can try." Then
they showed her a rough sketch of a flag and
asked what she thought of it. She replied that
she thought it ought to be longer, that a flag
looked better if the length was one third greater
than the width. She ventured to make two more
suggestions. One was that the stars which they
had scattered irregularly over the blue canton
would look better if they were arranged in some
regular form, such as a circle or a star or in parallel
rows. The second suggestion was that a
star with five points was prettier than one with
six. Some one seems to have remarked that it
would be more difficult to make; and thereupon
the skillful little lady folded a bit of paper and
with one clip of her scissors produced a star with
five points. The three gentlemen saw that her
suggestions were good, and General Washington
drew up his chair to a table and made another
sketch according to her ideas.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ross could make wise suggestions about
flags, but how to sew them she did not know;
so it was arranged that she should call on a
shipping merchant and borrow a flag from him.
This she soon did. He opened a chest and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
out a ship's flag to show her how the sewing was
done. She carried it home to use as a guide, and
when she reached the little house on Arch Street,
she set to work to make the first flag bearing the
stars and stripes. To try the effect, it was run
up to the peak of one of the vessels in the Delaware,
and the result was so pleasing that it
was carried into Congress on the day that it was
completed. Congress approved of the work of
the little lady. Colonel Ross told her to buy all
the material she could and make as many flags
as possible. And for more than fifty years she
continued to make flags for the Government.</p>

<p>This is the account that has come down to us,
not by tradition merely, but by written statements
of Mrs. Ross's daughters, grandchildren,
and others, to whom she often told the
story. Mrs. Ross says that this sample flag was
made just before the Declaration of Independence,
although the Resolution endorsing it was
not passed until June 14, 1777. This, however,
would not argue to the incorrectness of the account,
for Congress had a fashion of writing with
the utmost brevity the results of its deliberations,
and not putting in a word about the discussions
that must have taken place before the
passing of a resolution. Affairs of the utmost importance
were on hand, and after all it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
usefulness and convenience of the flag, rather
than its sentiment or the fact of its having
congressional authority, that was most in the
minds of men, and it is not impossible that this
design was in use long before the date of its official
recognition by Congress. The one real
weakness in the story is its lack of contemporary
evidence.</p>

<p>The significance of the new flag no one has
expressed better than Washington. "We take
the star from Heaven," he said, "red from our
mother country, separating it by white stripes,
thus showing that we have separated from her,
and the white stripes shall go down to posterity
representing liberty."</p>

<p>On the day of the passing of the resolution
about the Stars and Stripes, another one was
passed, which read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Resolved</i>, That Captain John Paul Jones be appointed
to command the ship Ranger.</p></div>

<p>"The flag and I are twins, born the same
hour," said Captain Jones. The Ranger was
launched in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and
there her captain went to take command. She
had no flag, but the captain was a favorite <a name="whereever" id="whereever"></a> whereever
he went, and a group of Portsmouth girls
soon held a "quilting party," but made a flag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
instead of a quilt. Moreover, as silk enough of
the proper colors could not be found in the stores
of Portsmouth, they made it from breadths of
their best silken gowns, red, white, and blue, the
story declares. Then Jones sailed away to see
how his little Ranger would behave when she
met a British man-of-war. He soon found out,
for the Ranger and the Drake met in combat, and
for the first time a British man-of-war struck her
colors to the new flag. This same little silken flag
was the first to receive a genuine foreign salute.
Early in 1778 the Ranger spoke the French fleet,
off Brest Roads. Captain Jones was willing to
take chances in a sea fight, but not in the matter
of a salute, and he sent a courteous note to
the French commander, informing him that the
flag worn by the Ranger was the new American
standard, which had never yet received a salute
from any foreign power. "If I offer a salute, will
it be returned gun for gun?" he queried. The
reply was that the same salute would be given
as to an admiral of Holland, or any other republic;
that is, four guns less than the salute
given. Captain Jones anchored in the entrance
of the bay and sought for further information.
He found that the reply of the admiral was
correct and according to custom. Therefore, on
the following day, he sailed through the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
fleet, saluting with thirteen guns, and receiving
nine. This was an acknowledgment of American
independence, and the first salute ever paid by
a foreign naval power to the Stars and Stripes.
It is true that a salute had been given to the
American brig, the Andrea Doria, before this,
by the Governor of one of the West Indian Islands;
but a salute which his Government immediately
disowned and for which he was called
home is rather an individual than a national
salute. Then, too, there is no proof that the
flag flown by the Andrea Doria was the Stars
and Stripes.</p>

<p>After a while Jones was put in command of
the Bon Homme Richard, a larger vessel than
the Ranger, but she flew the same little silken
flag. Off Flamborough Head he came up with
the British Serapis. After two hours of fighting,
Captain Pearson of the Serapis shouted, in a
moment's lull, "Have you struck your colors
yet?" "I haven't yet begun to fight," was
Jones's reply. The two ships were lashed together,
guns burst, cartridges exploded, wide
gaps were torn out of the sides of both vessels.
"Have you struck?" cried the British captain.
"No!" thundered Paul Jones. At last the Serapis
yielded; but the Bon Homme Richard was
fast sinking. Captain Jones left her and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
possession of the Serapis. The American vessel
rolled and lurched and pitched and plunged.
The little silken flag that had never been conquered
waved in the morning breeze for the last
time, and then went down, "flying on the ship
that conquered and captured the ship that sank
her."</p>

<p>When Paul Jones returned to America he met
one of the young girls who had given him the
flag. He told her how eagerly he had longed to
give it back into the hands of those who had
given it to him four years earlier. "But, Miss
Mary," he said, "I couldn't bear to strip it
from the poor old ship in her last agony, nor
could I deny to my dead on her decks, who had
given their lives to keep it flying, the glory of
taking it with them." In his journal he wrote
eloquently and almost as simply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No one was now left aboard the Richard but her
dead. To them I gave the good old ship for their
coffin, and in her they found a sublime sepulcher.
She rolled heavily in the long swell, her gun-deck
awash to the port-sills, settled slowly by the head,
and sank peacefully in about forty fathoms. The
ensign-gaff, shot away in action, had been fished and
put in place, soon after firing ceased, and our torn
and tattered flag was left flying when we abandoned
her. As she plunged down by the head at the last, her
taffrail momentarily rose in the air; so the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
last vestige mortal eyes ever saw of the Bon Homme
Richard was the defiant waving of her unconquered
and unstricken flag as she went down. And as I had
given them the good old ship for their sepulcher, I
now bequeathed to my immortal dead the flag they
had so desperately defended, for their winding sheet!</p></div>

<p>This is the story of the Portsmouth flag. At
first its truth was accepted without a doubt;
then it was seriously questioned. Within the last
few years, new evidence in the shape of family
tradition has strengthened its position.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>FLAGS ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE</h3>

<p>Probably the flag made by the skillful fingers
of Mrs. Elizabeth Griscom Ross was sewed with
the tiniest of stitches imaginable; but it is absolutely
certain that the flag which made its
appearance August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler,
afterwards Fort Stanwix, was not put together
with any such daintiness of workmanship. For
twenty days the little fort in the New York
wilderness, where Rome now stands, was besieged
by British and Indians. Reinforcements
brought the news of the adoption of the new
flag. The troops within the fort had no flag, and
therefore, in true American fashion, they set to
work to make one. There was not even a country
store to draw upon for materials, so they
made the best of what they had. As the story
has been handed down, a white shirt provided the
white stripes and the stars, and the petticoat of
a soldier's wife the red stripes. As for the blue
ground for the stars, it was cut from the cloak of
Captain Abram Swartwout. The result was not
very elegant, but it was a flag, and it was <i>the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
flag, and the besieged men were as proud of it
and stood for it as bravely as if it had been made
of damask with the daintiest of needlework.
August 22, 1777, the fort was relieved, and after
a few days Captain Swartwout began to be anxious
about his blue cloak. Colonel Peter Gansevoort,
who commanded the fort, had promised
him a new one to take the place of the one which
he had sacrificed for the flag, but it had not
arrived. Seven days he waited. At the end of
the seventh day he sent a note from Poughkeepsie,
where he then was, back to the fort, saying:
"You may Remember Agreeable to Your
promise, I was to have an Order for Eight Yards
of Broad-Cloath, on the Commissary for Cloathing
of this State In Lieu of my Blue Cloak, which
we Used for Coulours at Fort Schuyler. An opportunity
Now presenting itself, I beg You to
send me an Order." Broadcloth was broadcloth
in those days, and a "Blue Cloak" was not so
easily obtained. It is no wonder he wrote it with
capitals. It is to be hoped that the good captain
received his order; but it must have been a very
large cloak to require eight yards of "Broad-Cloath."</p>

<p>Another interesting banner was that borne by
Count Pulaski, a gallant Pole, who came to help
in the struggle for freedom. He visited Lafayette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
when the Frenchman was wounded and in the
care of the Moravian Sisterhood in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania. The embroidery of these Sisters
was very beautiful, and Pulaski engaged them to
make him a banner, which they did. On one side
were the letters "U.S.," and on the other the
thirteen stars in a circle, surrounding an eye
which is rather uncomfortably set in a triangle.
They made a mistake in spelling their Latin
motto, but the crimson banner, with its silver
fringe and its exquisite embroidery, was very
handsome. Longfellow's poem about this banner,
"Hymn of the Moravian Nuns of Bethlehem,"
is excellent poetry, but hardly accurate
history. It is quite probable that the good
women sent the banner forth with their blessing,
but it is rather doubtful whether they said anything
like the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Take thy banner, and if e'er</p>
<p>Thou shouldst press the soldier's bier,</p>
<p>And the muffled drums should beat</p>
<p>To the tread of mournful feet,</p>
<p>Then this crimson flag shall be</p>
<p>Martial cloak and shroud for thee";&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>for the beautiful little banner was only twenty
inches square! When Lafayette visited this
country in 1824, this little flag was borne in the
procession which welcomed him to Baltimore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>In the midst of the grief and horrors of war,
there was one day when all the armed ships in
the Delaware River were ablaze with the colors
of the United States in token of rejoicing. It
was July 4, 1777, the first anniversary of the
Declaration of Independence. Thirteen cannon
were fired, a great dinner was served to the members
of Congress and the officials of the army and
of the State. The Hessian band, which had been
captured at Trenton six months previously, performed
some of their merriest music. Toasts
followed the dinner, each one honored by a discharge
of artillery and small arms and a piece
of music by the Hessians. At night the city was
illuminated and the streets resounded with hurrahs
and the ringing of bells. Then came fireworks,
which began and ended with thirteen
rockets in honor of the thirteen United States.</p>

<p>"Thirteen" appeared not only as the number
of stars on the flag, but everywhere else, and at
Valley Forge, in the rejoicing over the new alliance
with France, the officers marched up to
the place of entertainment thirteen abreast and
with arm linked in arm. A disrespectful English
paper declared that the "rebels" ate thirteen
dried clams a day, that it took thirteen "Congress
paper dollars" to equal one English shilling,
that "every well-organized rebel household has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
thirteen children, all of whom expect to be major-generals
or members of the high and mighty
congress of the thirteen United States when they
attain the age of thirteen years."</p>

<p>When the war had come to an end, the artist
Copley was in London working on the portrait
of an American, Elkanah Watson. In the background
of the portrait was a ship supposed to be
bearing to America the news of the acknowledgment
of Independence. The rising sun was shining
upon the place where the flag should have
been, but no flag was there. Copley's studio was
often visited by the royal family, so he waited.
But a day came when the artist heard the speech
of the King acknowledging the Independence of
America. He went straightway to his studio and
painted in the flag floating in the rays of the
rising sun.</p>

<p>Soon after the close of the war, a wide-awake
skipper of Nantucket, who had some
whale oil to sell, appeared at London. Nantucket
was so helpless for both offense and defense that
it had remained neutral, and the captain had
received from Admiral Digby a license to go to
London. A London magazine of the time said,
"This is the first vessel which has displayed the
thirteen rebellious stripes of America in any
British port." Nobody knew exactly what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
do, but apparently the whale oil was soon sold,
for the enterprising whaler returned directly to
Nantucket.</p>

<p>In October, 1783, most of the British troops
had sailed away from the United States, but Sir
Guy Carleton was delayed in New York waiting
for vessels. When the day came for him to leave
the city, a strong, determined woman who kept
a boarding-house brought out a United States
flag and ran it up on a pole in front of her house.
Down the street came a British officer with headlong
speed. "We do not evacuate this city until
noon. Haul down that flag!" he shouted angrily.
"That flag went up to stay, and it will not be
hauled down!" declared the indignant housekeeper,
and went on sweeping in front of her
door. "Then I will pull it down myself," thundered
the irate officer, and set to work. But the
halyards were entangled, and all the officer's
swearing and scolding did not help matters. The
militant lady of the broom then applied her
weapon to the officer. The powder flew from his
wig in a cloud, and at last he himself had to fly,
leaving the flag to float serenely on the morning
breeze. This encounter has been called the last
battle of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Before leaving Fort George, at the foot of
Broadway, in New York, the British soldiers mischievously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
nailed their flag to the top of the pole,
took down the halyards, greased the pole from
top to bottom, and knocked off the cleats. They
did not know how well the American boys could
climb; in a very short time new cleats were nailed
on, the English flag was pulled down, and the Stars
and Stripes floated from the top of the pole.</p>

<p>News of King George's proclamation did not
reach the United States till the middle of April,
and then there was rejoicing, indeed. It is no
wonder that the joy of the country at the closing
of the war burst out in celebrations and silken
flags. The diary of President Stiles, of Yale,
tells what took place in New Haven. It reads
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>April 24, 1783.</i> Public rejoicing for the Peace in
New Haven. At sunrise thirteen cannon discharged
in the Green, and the continental flag displayed, being
a grand silk flag presented by the ladies, cost 120 dollars.
The stripes red and white, with an azure field
in the upper part charged with thirteen stars. On the
same field and among the stars was the arms of the
United States, the field of which contained a ship, a
plough, and three sheaves of wheat; the crest an eagle
volant; the supporters two white horses. The arms
were put on with paint and gilding. It took &mdash;&mdash; yards.
When displayed it appeared well.</p></div>

<p>The patriotic ladies who presented the flag
had taken the arms and motto, "Virtue, Liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Independence," from the title-page of a family
Bible; but unluckily, this Bible, having been
published in Philadelphia, displayed the arms
and motto, not of the United States, but of
Pennsylvania. The moral is, learn the arms of
your country.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE FLAG OF FIFTEEN STRIPES AND<br />
FIFTEEN STARS</h3>

<p>The worthy fathers of our country were long-sighted
men. In many respects they peered far
into the future and they laid well the foundations
for a great republic. One thing, however, they
forgot; when they chose a design for a flag with
thirteen stripes and a circle of thirteen stars,
they did not realize that the number of States
would probably increase, and that these States
would wish to be represented on the flag. In
1791 Vermont was admitted as a State, and in
1792 Kentucky also came into the Union. In
1794 the Senate passed a bill increasing to fifteen
the number of both stripes and stars. This bill
was sent to the House, and then came exciting
times. Some members thought it of great importance
not to offend new States by giving them
no recognition on the flag. Others called it dishonorable
to waste time over what one man
called "a consummate piece of frivolity," when
matters "of infinitely greater consequence"
ought to be discussed. Another declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the Senate sent the bill for the want of something
better to do. Yet another honorable member did
not think it worth while either to adopt or reject
the proposed law, but supposed "the shortest
way to get rid of it was to agree to it." Whether
to "get rid of it" or not, the bill was passed, and
went into effect May 1, 1795.</p>

<p>This flag of fifteen stripes and fifteen stars was
the one worn by the frigate Constitution, "Old
Ironsides." When, in 1830, it was reported that
this vessel, with its magnificent record, was to be
broken up, Holmes wrote his stirring poem, "Old
Ironsides," which ends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Oh, better that her shattered hulk</p>
<p class="i2">Should sink beneath the wave;</p>
<p>Her thunders shook the mighty deep,</p>
<p class="i2">And there should be her grave;</p>
<p>Nail to the mast her holy flag,</p>
<p class="i2">Set every threadbare sail,</p>
<p>And give her to the god of storms,</p>
<p class="i2">The lightning and the gale!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was this flag under which we went forth to
three wars, each one fought to uphold the rights
of American citizens. The first was with France,
the second with Tripoli, and the third with Great
Britain. It had long been the custom for nations
using the Mediterranean Sea to pay tribute to
the pirates of Tripoli. In 1800 Captain Bainbridge
carried the annual tribute to Algiers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
seemed that the Dey wished to send an ambassador
to Constantinople, and under threat of
capture Captain Bainbridge was ordered to
carry him there. The captain obeyed, but very
unwillingly. When the new flag appeared at
Constantinople, it was reported to the Sultan
that a ship from the United States of America
was in the harbor. "What's that?" he demanded.
"I never heard of that nation." "They
live in the New World which Columbus discovered,"
was the reply. The Sultan had heard
of Columbus, and he sent to the frigate a bouquet
of flowers in welcome, and a lamp in token
of friendship.</p>

<p>The Dey of Algiers became dissatisfied with
the tribute paid by America, and declared
haughtily that if he did not receive from our
country a handsome present within six months,
he should declare war. This he did, but to his
great surprise a small American fleet, under the
fifteen stars and stripes, sailed up to his city and
began to bombard it. It was not long before he
became the very picture of meekness. He freed
all his American captives, paid well for all the
property that he had destroyed, and the Mediterranean
Sea became safe for commerce.</p>

<p>In 1803 the United States purchased from
France the immense Louisiana Territory. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
French flag was hauled down and the flag of the
United States was raised in token of the change
of ownership. This country had first been in
the hands of Spain, and the Spaniards had presented
flags to various Indians. When Lieutenant
Z. M. Pike made a journey of exploration in
the new territory, he came to an Indian village
where there was quite a display of Spanish banners.
The Lieutenant made a little speech to the
Indians, and said among other things that the
Spanish flag at the chief's door ought to be given
up to him and the flag of the United States put
in its place. The Indians listened, but made
no reply. Lieutenant Pike spoke again to the
same effect. "Your nation cannot have two fathers,"
he said. "You must be the children of
the Spaniards or else of the Americans." The red
men sat in silence awhile, then an old man arose,
walked slowly to the door, took the Spanish flag
down, and put the American in its place. Then
he gave the flag of Spain to his followers, bidding
them, "Never hoist this again&mdash;while the Americans
are here." Surely, the old chief must have
been akin to Dr. John Cotton of Colonial fame.
This scene occurred in what is now Kansas, and
is thought to have been the first raising of the
United States flag in that State.</p>

<p>The banner of fifteen stripes and fifteen stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
has a proud record, for this was the flag that inspired
Francis Scott Key to write "The Star-Spangled
Banner." Every one knows the story
of the poem, how the author and an agent for
the exchange of prisoners went on board a British
vessel in 1814 to try to secure the release of a
physician who had been captured. The English
admiral granted their request, but as he was
about to attack Fort McHenry, he told them
that they would not be permitted to return at
once, but must remain on their own vessel, with
a British guard, until the fort was reduced. If
this order had been carried out, they would have
been on board to-day, for the fort never was reduced.
All day the Americans could see the
Stars and Stripes flying over its ramparts, in
spite of attacks by sea and by land. Night came,
and it was only by "the rockets' red glare, the
bombs bursting in air," that they knew whether
the fort yet stood. At length the firing ceased,
and all was darkness. They could do nothing but
wait for the first rays of morning in the hope that
"by the dawn's early light" they could catch a
glimpse of the flag and know that the fort had
not yielded, that "our flag was still there," and
that the British were retreating. Then it was that
Key wrote, on the back of an old envelope, "The
Star-Spangled Banner," and put into it such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
thrill of sincerity that it is just as throbbing with
life and patriotism as it was on that September
dawn a century ago. The banner that inspired
the poem is in the National Museum in Washington.</p>

<p>Francis Scott Key died in Baltimore in 1843,
and is buried in Frederick, Maryland. Over his
grave a large national flag flies day and night,
never removed save when wear and tear make
a new flag necessary. In Baltimore a noble
monument has been reared in his honor. It is
surmounted by the figure of the poet, who waves
his hat with one hand and with the other points
joyfully toward the fort. The figure is so life-like
that one almost expects it to cry,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave</p>
<p>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A few months after "The Star-Spangled Banner"
was written, a plan was formed to rear
in the city of Baltimore a monument in honor
of George Washington. It was fitting that the
place of his birth should also be marked, and a
few days before the laying of the corner-stone
of the monument, a little company sailed from
Alexandria, Virginia, to Pope's Creek, Westmoreland
County, where Washington was born.
With them they carried a simple freestone slab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
on which was chiseled his name and the date of
his birth. Wrapped in the banner of fifteen stars,
it was borne reverently to its resting-place by
the hands of the descendants of four Revolutionary
patriots.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER</h3>

<p>"Time makes ancient good uncouth," said
Lowell, and so it was with the flag. The flag of
fifteen stars and fifteen stripes that was decreed
in 1795 then represented each State; but in less
than one year it was out of date. Tennessee had
come into the Union. Then followed Ohio, Louisiana,
and Indiana. Here were four States with no
representation in the colors of the country. Then,
too, people began to realize that in giving up the
thirteen stripes they had lost their old significant
"Thirteen," and dropped a valuable historical
association. At length the matter came before
Congress, and for nearly sixteen months it remained
there. Occasionally there was some little
discussion about it. One member proposed that
the matter be postponed indefinitely. "Are you
willing to neglect the banner of freedom?" demanded
another. Yet another thought it unnecessary
to insist upon thirteen stripes, and
thought they might as well fix upon nine or
eleven or any other arbitrary number as thirteen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
The committee pleaded for the significant thirteen,
and so it went on. At length Peter H.
Wendover, of New York, through whose efforts
Congress was held to its duty, called the attention
of the House to the fact that the Government
itself was paying no respect to its own laws
in regard to the flag; that the law demanded
fifteen stripes, but that Congress was at that
moment displaying a banner of thirteen stripes;
that the navy yard and the marine barracks
were flying flags of eighteen stripes; and that during
the first session of the preceding Congress
the flag floating over their deliberations had had,
from some unknown cause or other, only nine
stripes.</p>

<p>It is small wonder that after such an arraignment
as this the lawmakers aroused themselves.
The following bill was passed, and was signed by
President Monroe, April 4, 1818:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> <i>Be it enacted, etc.</i>, That from and after
the fourth day of July next, the flag of the United
States be thirteen horizontal stripes, alternate red
and white; that the union have twenty stars, white
in a blue field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That on the
admission of every new State into the Union, one
star be added to the union of the flag; and that such
addition shall take effect on the fourth of July next
succeeding such admission.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>So it was that the flag of the United States
was finally decided upon. Captain S. C. Reid
designed it, and his wife made a specimen flag,
which was hoisted on the flagstaff of the House
of Representatives a few days after the law
legalizing it was passed. Forty-one years later,
in 1859, Congress formally thanked Captain
Reid. The one weak point in this law was that
the arrangement of the stars on the blue field
was left to the taste of the owner of the flag.
Captain Reid arranged them in one large star;
but it was evident that if this plan was continued,
as new States were admitted, the stars would
become too small to be seen distinctly. The
Navy Commissioners issued the order that in
naval flags the stars should be arranged in five
rows, four stars in a row; but for many years
merchant vessels paid small attention to this
decree. Indeed, in 1837 the Dutch Government
inquired, with all respect, "What is the American
flag?" Twenty years later an observant man
in Jersey City amused himself on the Fourth of
July by noting the numerous fashions in which
the stars were arranged. He said that all flags
had the thirteen stripes&mdash;though not always
in the proper order&mdash;but that he had counted
nine different fashions in which the stars were
arranged. They appeared in one large star, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
lozenge, a diamond, or a circle, and one vessel
in the river flaunted an anchor formed of stars.
It was suggested that Congress ought to order
some regular arrangement, but Congress did not
take the hint. The Secretary of War and the
Secretary of the Navy gave orders in 1912, after
the admission of New Mexico and Arizona, that
the stars, now forty-eight, should be arranged in
six rows of eight stars each. This was approved
by the President, but no decree has been passed
by Congress.</p>

<p>Until 1866 our country's flag was manufactured
in a foreign land. Bunting in a flag has
a hard life. It must meet sun, wind, and storm;
it must be light enough to float at every breeze
and strong enough to endure severe wear. Attempts
had been made many years earlier to
make bunting in the United States, and flags
of home manufacture had been tried again and
again, but they had never stood the tests. In
1865, however, Congress put a duty of forty per
cent on imported bunting, and also made it
lawful for the Government to purchase its flags
in the United States. With this duty manufacturers
could compete with the lower wages paid
in England, and now it became worth while to
set to work in earnest. Within a year the thing
had been done. A company in Lowell, Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
presented to the Senate a flag manufactured
in the United States. It was hoisted over
the Capitol, and for the first time this country,
then ninety years old, floated over its Congress a
banner of bunting woven and made "at home."
This banner stood all the tests, and soon the
price of the material was greatly reduced. Since
the manufacture of this flag all bunting used in
flags for the navy has come from Lowell. It must
be of a fixed weight and strength and must be
absolutely fast color in sun and rain. These
flags are made in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and
they must be accurate in every detail. Even the
number of stitches to the inch is a matter of rule.
After the stripes have been sewed together and
the stars stitched upon the canton, the hoist, or
end of the flag which is to be next to the staff, is
firmly bound with canvas, and the lines, etc.,
attached. Then the flag is stamped with the
date. Many silken flags are used in the navy, but
these are made entirely by hand.</p>

<p>A warship must have not only her own flags,
but those of foreign countries, sometimes two
hundred and fifty or more. Some of these flags
are of very complicated design, and the flag-makers
tried the experiment of painting the designs
on the bunting. This was not a success,
because the flags stuck together, and now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
whole design is worked out in bunting. The
navy makes its own flags, but the War Department
buys what are needed. Manufacturers
make large numbers for general sale; between
nine and ten million a year even in times of
peace.</p>

<p>The pet name, "Old Glory," is believed to
have been given to the flag by Captain William
Driver. He was born in Salem, Massachusetts,
became a shipmaster, and at length made his
home in Nashville, Tennessee. When the Civil
War broke out, he stood boldly by the Union,
even though his own family were against him.
More than thirty years before this date, just as
he was starting on a voyage, some of his friends
made him a present of a handsome American
flag. When the breeze first caught it and spread
out its folds, Captain Driver exclaimed, "Old
Glory!" and "Old Glory" it was to him all the
years of his life. The flag went to Tennessee with
him, and was hung out on every day of public
rejoicing. When the war broke out, his Confederate
neighbors tried their best to get possession
of that flag; but they did not realize the resources
of the old captain. Sailors know how to sew, and
he had carefully quilted his beloved banner into
his comforter. No wonder that he had not the
least objection to having his house searched for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
it. When the Union troops entered the city,
Captain Driver asked permission to run up his
flag over the State Capitol. This was granted,
and with an escort he marched to the building
and ran up the flag. As he stood gazing at it with
tears in his eyes, he said, "I have always said
that if I could see it float over that Capitol, I
should have lived long enough; now Old Glory
is up there, gentlemen, and I am ready to die."
The captain's own particular "Old Glory" was
full of years and weakened by service, and on the
following day he reverently took it down and ran
up a flag that was new and strong. For a quarter
of a century he saw the Union flag float over the
Capitol of his chosen State. Then, at his death
in 1886, his own "Old Glory" was sent to the
Essex Institute at his birthplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE FLAG IN WAR</h3>

<p>"Old Glory" has flown over the battle-fields
of three wars; the Mexican, the Civil War, and
the war with Spain. In the war with Mexico
victory depended upon taking the City of Mexico,
and the path to that lay in the capture of the
strong castle of Chapultepec. Long before sunrise
one bright September morning, the American
guns began to roar. All day long the Americans
fired from below and the Mexicans from
above. Fortunately for the attackers, the aim
of the Mexicans was anything but accurate,
and in twenty-four hours the American troops
were pushing forward up the hillside, through a
grove full of sharpshooters, over rocks and gullies,
even over mines, which the Mexicans had no
chance to set off. Cannon roared and volleys of
musketry were fired at the assailants, but they
dashed over the redoubt, up, still up, to the
escarpment, and over it they tumbled. Meanwhile
the Mexicans were standing on the city
walls and peering out from the spires of the
cathedral. They saw, as the Americans pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
on and up, the Stars and Stripes appear, now to
the right, now to the left, as point after point
was taken. Now the Americans had reached the
main works. The scaling-ladders were planted
and the men scrambled over the wall. Even
then the Mexicans were not without a faint hope,
for their banner still floated over the highest
pinnacle. Suddenly it disappeared, and the
Stars and Stripes took its place. The victory had
been won. On the second day after the first gun
was fired at Chapultepec, the American troops
were following their flag into the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>The Civil War began with the firing upon Fort
Sumter. Shot came in a whirlwind, half a score
of balls at a time. The woodwork blazed, the
brick and stone flew in all directions. Red-hot
balls from the furnace in Moultrie dashed down
like a pitiless hailstorm. The barracks were
ablaze, streams of fire burst out of the quarters.
Ninety barrels of powder were rolled into the
water lest it should explode in the awful heat.
The men were stifled with fumes from the burning
buildings. Over the horrors of this attack
the Stars and Stripes floated serenely from the
staff, flashing out, as each gust of wind tossed
the clouds of smoke aside for a moment, the
glories of the red, white, and blue, clear and calm
and unscathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Beams fell with a crash, ammunition in one
magazine exploded, black clouds of smoke filled
the fort, and for hours the men covered their
faces with wet cloths to keep from suffocating.
Nine times the flagstaff was struck by a shot,
and at the ninth the flag fell. Lieutenant Hall
dashed into the storm of balls, caught up the
flag, and brought it away. The halyards were
cut and tangled. The flag could not be raised,
but it was nailed to the staff, and in the midst of
the incessant fire, Sergeant Peter Hart fastened
it up on the ramparts. The fort surrendered, but
not the flag; for as Major Anderson and his men
left the burning ruins, they saluted "Old Glory"
with fifty guns, then lowered it, and, as the
Major stated to the Government, "marched
out of the fort with colors flying and drums
beating."</p>

<p>This was on April 14, 1861. On April 14, 1865,
when the war was virtually over, Major Anderson,
now General Anderson, was, by order of
President Lincoln, called to Fort Sumter to
raise again the flag which he had so unwillingly
lowered. A special steamer carried from New
York to the fort a number of prominent citizens.
Hundreds came from elsewhere by land to
Charleston and were taken to the fort by vessel.
Two hundred officers of the navy were present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and many army officers. After the opening exercises,
Sergeant Hart opened a big carpetbag
and drew forth the identical flag that had been
hauled down four years earlier. The banner was
unfurled, the assemblage cheered to the echo, and
slowly the beloved banner rose to its old position,
every one trying his best to catch hold of the
rope and help raise it. Hats were waved and the
old fort rang with cheers. The band struck up
"The Star-Spangled Banner." A salute was
fired by the guns on Fort Sumter, and this was
responded to by every fort and battery that had
fired upon Sumter in April, 1861. Henry Ward
Beecher, orator of the day, made a thrilling
address. Of the flag he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There flies the same flag that was insulted. In the
storm of that assault this glorious ensign was often
struck; but, memorable fact, not one of its stars was
torn out, by shot or shell. It was a prophecy....
Lifted to the air, to-day it proclaims, after four years
of war, "Not a State is blotted out!"</p>

<p>Hail to the flag of our fathers, and our flag! Glory
to the banner that has gone through four years black
with tempests of war, to pilot the nation back to
peace without dismemberment! And glory be to
God, who, above all hosts and banners, hath ordained
victory, and shall ordain peace!... In the name of
God, we lift up our banner, and dedicate it to Peace,
Union and Liberty, now and forevermore.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>A few years later General Anderson died. He
was buried at West Point and was carried to his
grave wrapped in the flag that he had defended
so bravely. On the death of his wife the flag
passed by her gift into the hands of the War
Department.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting flags of the recent
war with Spain was borne by the First Regiment
of the United States Volunteer Cavalry.
A squadron of men for this regiment left Ph&oelig;nix,
Arizona, on their way to the field of war. It was
noticed that they had no flag. The women of
the Relief Corps attached to the Grand Army of
the Republic took the matter in hand, for if this
was not a case where relief was needed, where
should one be found?</p>

<p>Night and day were the same to these energetic
women. They bought silk and they sewed,
all day and all night. The stores of Ph&oelig;nix did
not provide just the right sort of cord, so the
staff of the battle-flag was daintily adorned with
a knot of satin ribbon, red, white, and blue.
Then the flag was carried to camp, and presented
with all courtesy and dignity to the two hundred
men who were to form a part of the First Regiment
of the United States Volunteer Cavalry,
better known as the "Rough Riders."</p>

<p>The little silken flag came to glories that it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
not dreamed of, for the regular bunting flags
were scarce, and therefore it held the most prominent
place in parades and was even set up as
guest of honor before the tent of Colonel Leonard
Wood. In the attack on Santiago, the little
party that first landed at Daiquiri, a small town
on the coast a few miles from the city, carried
the flag with them. On a transport in the
harbor an officer from Arizona, observing the
troops climb the hill, had seen the raising of
the flag and discovered with a glass what it was.
As the story is told:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He threw his hat to the deck, jumped to the top of
the bulwark, and yelled: "Howl, you Arizona men,&mdash;it's
our flag up there!"</p>

<p>And the men howled as only Arizona cowboys
could. Some one on the hurricane deck grabbed the
whistle cord and tied it down, the band of the Second
Infantry whisked up instruments and played
"A Hot Time" on the inspiration of the moment,
and every man who had a revolver emptied it over the
side. Almost in an instant every whistle of the fifty
transports and supply vessels in the harbor took up
the note of rejoicing. Twenty thousand men were
cheering. A dozen bands increased the din. Then
guns of the warships on the flanks joined in a mighty
salute to the flag of the Nation. And the flag was the
flag of the Arizona squadron.</p>

<p>The Arizona flag led the regiment in the fight
of Las Guasimas, where three thousand intrenched
Spaniards were driven back by nine hundred unmounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
cavalry; it was at the front all through
the heat of the battles of Kettle Hill and San Juan
Hill; it waved over the trenches before Santiago, and
was later borne through the captured city to the
transport.</p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE FLAG IN PEACE</h3>

<p>One of the greatest achievements of our flag
in peace was the opening of Japan. In 1852
Commodore M. C. Perry was sent with a letter
from President Fillmore to prepare the way for
a treaty of peace and friendship and commerce
with Japan. Its delivery was a matter of much
ceremony. After a long delay a day was set for
its reception. When the time had come, the
officers in full uniform, the marines in blue and
white, the sailors in navy blue and tarpaulins,
and last of all the Commodore entered the boats.
As the Commodore stepped into his barge, a
salute of thirteen guns was given. Then the
two bands struck up lively tunes and the boats
made for the shore.</p>

<p>Along the beach were ranged nine tall crimson
standards, surrounded by flags of all sorts
and colors. Five or six thousand soldiers were
drawn up in line, and the hills behind them
were crowded with people. When the Americans
came to land, a procession was formed.
First, the marines and sailors, then the one flag of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the procession, the Stars and Stripes, its brilliant
colors flashing in the bright sunshine. It was
borne by the two tallest, broadest-shouldered
men among the sailors of the squadron. After
the flag came two of the younger men, carrying a
rosewood box mounted with gold and carefully
wrapped in a scarlet cloth. In this were the credentials
of the Commodore and the letter of the
President. These were written on vellum, and
the seals were attached by cords of silk and
gold, ending in tassels of gold. Then came the
Commodore, and on either side of him was a tall
negro of fine proportions and armed to the teeth.
After the Commodore walked the officers of the
squadron. Commodore and officers were escorted
into the handsomely decorated hall of reception.
The court interpreter asked if the letter
was ready. The two pages, guarded by the two
stalwart negroes, were summoned and placed
the letter upon a handsome box of red lacquer,
which was ready to receive them. The Commodore
made a formal bow. The bands played our
national airs, and all returned to the vessels as
ceremoniously as they had come.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of intercourse between
the United States and Japan. Two years later
a treaty was signed, and in 1860 an embassy
from Japan visited this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>So it was that Japan was opened to the world.
In 1901 the Japanese Minister of Justice said:
"Commodore Perry's visit was, in a word, the
turn of the key which opened the doors of the
Japanese Empire. Japan has not forgotten&mdash;nor
will she ever forget&mdash;that, next to her
reigning and most beloved sovereign, whose
rare virtue and great wisdom is above all praise,
she owes her present state of prosperity to the
United States of America." "Are you coming
over here to fight us?" a young Japanese in this
country was playfully asked. "Fight the United
States?" he exclaimed. "The United States is
our friend." And drawing himself up to his full
height, he said proudly, "The Japanese do not
forget. We know what your Commodore Perry
and your country have done for us."</p>

<p>The American flag was first seen in China in
1784. The Chinese said it was "as beautiful as
a flower," and for many years they always spoke
of it as the "flower flag."</p>

<p>A custom of great significance and value, that
of raising the home flag over legations and consulates
in foreign lands whenever a home holiday
comes around, is due to the tact and ready wit
of one of our Ministers to Sweden, William W.
Thomas, Jr. The following is his own account
of the event:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>On taking possession of the archives and property
of the United States at Stockholm, I was surprised to
find there was no American flag there. Talking with
my colleagues, the Ministers of other countries, I was
informed that no foreign Minister at Stockholm ever
hoisted his country's flag, and that to do so would be
considered a breach of diplomatic etiquette.</p>

<p>What was I to do? I did not wish to offend my
good friends, the Swedes; that was the last thing a
Minister should be guilty of. And I certainly did not
want to see an American holiday go by without
hoisting the American flag from the American Legation.
The question troubled me a great deal.</p>

<p>All at once a thought seized me, like an inspiration.
I sent to America for a flag. I procured flagstaff and
halyards, and from my own drawings I had carved
an American eagle, which was gilded and perched on
top of the flag pole. Flag, eagle, and staff I concealed
in the Legation, and bided my time.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the greatest character Sweden has
ever produced is Gustavus Adolphus. His life and
deeds belong not to Sweden along, but to the world.
Well, when the anniversary of the death and victory
of this great captain of the Swedish host came round,&mdash;the
6th of November, 1883,&mdash;and when the great
choral societies of Stockholm, bearing banners and
followed by vast multitudes of the Swedish populace,
marched through the streets of Sweden's capital,
and gathered about the mausoleum on the Island
of Knights, where lies the mighty dead, sang p&aelig;ans
in his praise, then it happened, somehow, that, regardless
of precedent or custom, the flag of the free
republic&mdash;aye! flag, flagstaff, golden eagle, and all&mdash;was
run out from the American Legation; and the
starry banner of America waved in unison with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
yellow cross of Sweden, in honor of the mightiest
warrior for the freedom of our faith.</p>

<p>This act was everywhere approved in Sweden. It
was praised by both the people and the press. After
this, it may well be believed, the flag of America
floated unchallenged in the capital of the Northland.
It waved on high on the birthday of Washington, on
that Memorial Day when we decorate the graves of
our brave boys in blue who saved the Union, and on
the Fourth of July, that gave the Republic birth.
But I hoisted our flag impartially, on Swedish holidays
as well as our own; and the Stars and Stripes
floated out as proudly on the birthday of King Oscar
as on that of Washington.</p></div>

<p>"If any man attempts to haul down the American
flag, shoot him on the spot," commanded
General Dix; but the United States may well
be proud of having herself hauled down her
flag on one occasion not many years ago. After
the Spanish-American War had been fought,
the treaty of peace with Spain put Cuba into
the hands of the United States, and the star-spangled
banner was raised and saluted. This
was in 1899. The three years following this act
were busy ones with the War Department, for
in its control was left the management of all
Cuban affairs. Cuba was cleaned up, the yellow
fever stamped out, schools were established,
peace restored, a constitution adopted by the
people, and a president elected. May 20, 1902,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was the date set for the sovereignty of Cuba to
pass into the hands of the Cubans. The island
had been made free, and now she was coming to
her own. Havana was in her best. Flags floated
from every house. Ships displayed both the
American and the Cuban flags. When the moment
arrived, General Leonard Wood read the
transfer, and the President-elect signed it in the
name of the new Republic. To free Cuba from
oppression the United States had entered into
war. Our country sought nothing for itself, and
now the freedom of the island was attained, and
the American forces were to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>After the signing of the transfer Governor-General
Wood loosened the halyards and the
star-spangled banner was lowered, having accomplished
nobly that for which it had been
raised. As it sank slowly down the Union salute
of forty-five guns was fired. Then, by the hands
of General Wood, the Cuban flag was hoisted
to its position and floated proudly over a free
country. A national salute of twenty-one guns
was fired in its honor, and the history of the
Cuban Republic had begun. As the <i>New York
Sun</i> said, "No country ever before conquered a
territory at great sacrifice to set up a government
other than its own."</p>

<p>In the hands of Admiral Robert E. Peary our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
flag has won the honors of the Northland. Many
others had gone <i>far</i> north; for Peary it was reserved
to go <i>farthest</i> north, to the Pole itself.
This was no chance success, brought about by
fine equipment and favorable weather; it was
the fair result of careful preparation and hard
work. The Admiral wrote in his journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Pole at last! The prize of three centuries, my
dream and goal for twenty years, mine at last! I cannot
bring myself to realize it.</p>

<p>It all seems so simple and commonplace. As Bartlett
said when turning back, when speaking of his
being in these exclusive regions, which no mortal had
ever penetrated before, "It is just like every day!"</p></div>

<p>A little later, in acknowledging with gratitude
the generous aid which he had received, the
Admiral wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Their assistance has enabled me to tell the last of
the great earth stories, the story the world has been
waiting to hear for three hundred years&mdash;the story
of the discovery of the North Pole.</p></div>

<p>Such is the history of the flag of the United
States of America from the time when a little
group of colonies dared to raise their own standard
and oppose their feeble strength and their
slender resources to the trained armies and the
ample wealth of England.</p>

<p>This was a century and a half ago. The Republic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
has come of age and has accepted her
rightful share of the responsibilities of the world.
The mother country rejoiced to do her honor,
and on one brilliant April morning in 1917 the
cities of England flung out her banner beside
their own. In London the Stars and Stripes were
everywhere&mdash;in the hands of the people in the
streets, on private houses, on public buildings,
even on the "Victory Tower" of Westminster
Palace, where before that day no other flag save
the Union Jack or the royal standard had ever
been raised. In the historic cathedral of St. Paul
four thousand people had come together to
thank God for the alliance between the mother
country and her eldest child, that in this war of
the world "they should go forth and try the matter
in fight by the help of God"&mdash;to quote the
text of the Bishop of London. The two flags,
of Great Britain and of the United States of
America, hung side by side over the chancel rail.
The thousands of people rose with reverence and
sang, first, "The Star-Spangled Banner," and
then, "God Save the King." And so it was that
Great Britain and the United States took their
stand shoulder to shoulder in the world-wide
struggle to make sure "that government of the
people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>HOW TO BEHAVE TOWARD THE FLAG</h3>

<p>Except the cross there is nothing that the
American should hold more sacred than the flag
of the United States, because of its record in
peace and in war, and because it stands for the
rights and the freedom of one hundred million
citizens.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Sign of a nation great and strong,</p>
<p>To ward her people from foreign wrong."</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are definite rules in regard to the use
of the flag. The following are the most necessary
to know:&mdash;</p>

<p>The flag should be raised at sunrise and lowered
at sunset. It should not be left out at night
unless under fire. It should not be allowed to
touch the ground. If possible, a pole rather than
a staff should be used.</p>

<p>In raising a flag to half-mast or half-staff,
it should be run to the top of the pole, and then
lowered the width of the flag. Before being
retired, it should be run to the top again. On
Memorial Day the flag should be at half-mast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
until noon, and at the peak from noon until
sunset.</p>

<p>When the flag goes by, rise if you are sitting;
halt if you are walking, and take off your hat.</p>

<p>In decorating, never drape the flag; always
hang it flat. The Union should be at the observer's
left, whether the stripes are perpendicular
or horizontal. If our flag is crossed
with the flags of other countries, or carried in
a parade beside them, it should always be at the
right.</p>

<p>In unveiling a monument, the flag should
never be allowed to drop to the ground, but so
arranged that it can be drawn up and will then
float over the monument.</p>

<p>If draped over a casket, the blue field should
be at the head. If used as the covering of an
altar, nothing except the Bible should be placed
upon it, and the union should be at the right.</p>

<p>Distress at sea is indicated by hanging the
flag union down.</p>

<p>Always stand when "The Star-Spangled Banner"
is played.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>For those people who, whether maliciously
or ignorantly, show any disrespect to the flag,
strenuous laws have been passed in most of the
States. In Massachusetts, a post of the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Army or a camp of Spanish War veterans may
put the name of the organization upon the
flag, but no other lettering is permitted. Any
one who mutilates the flag or in any way treats
it with contempt is likely to fare worse than did
John Endicott in colonial days. The same respect
is required to be shown to the flags of all
countries with which the United States is at
peace.</p>

<p>The representation of the flag must not be
used to advertise merchandise, but it may be
used on any publication designed to give information
about the flag, or to promote patriotism,
or to encourage the study of American
history.</p>

<p>June 14, the anniversary of the day in 1777
on which the flag was adopted, has been chosen
as "Flag Day."</p>

<p>The length of a flag should be very nearly
twice its height, or, to be exact, in the proportion
of 1.9 to 1. The length of the union should
be three fourths the height of the whole flag;
the height of the union should be that of seven
stripes.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little fancifully, a star has been
assigned to each State in the order of its ratification
of the Constitution and admission to
the Union. Beginning at the left upper corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and reading each row from left to right, the

<h2>FLAG ANNIVERSARIES</h2>

<p class="p2">January 1-2, 1776: Grand Union Flag (British Union
and thirteen stripes) hoisted over Washington's
headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts.
This was the first real flag of the colonies.</p>

<p class="p2">January 13, 1794: American flag changed by act of
Congress, owing to two new States (Kentucky
and Vermont) being admitted to the Union. The
flag now had two stars and two stripes added to
it, making fifteen stripes and stars. This was
the "Star-Spangled Banner," and under this
flag our country fought and won three wars&mdash;the
so-called naval war with France, in 1798-1800;
that with the Barbary States in 1801-1805;
and that with England in 1812-1815.</p>

<p class="p2">February 3, <a name="February" id="February"></a> 1783: First appearance of the American
flag in a British port by the ship Bedford,
of Massachusetts, which arrived in the river
Thames on this date.</p>

<p class="p2">February 8, 1776: Colonial Congressional Committee
accepted a naval flag, consisting of thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white, with a rattlesnake
diagonally across it.</p>

<p class="p2">February 14, 1778: First foreign salute to the Stars
and Stripes. John Paul Jones entered Quiberon
Bay, near Brest, France, and received a salute
of nine guns from the French fleet, under
Admiral La Motte Piquet. Jones had previously
saluted the French fleet with thirteen guns.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>March 17, 1776: The first display of the Grand
Union Flag in Boston was on the day that town
was evacuated by the British.</p>

<p class="p2">April 4, 1818: Congress by act decreed a return to the
original thirteen stripes and a star for every
State in the Union, to be added to the flag on
the July 4 following a State's admission to the
Union. This is the present law in relation to the
flag.</p>

<p class="p2">April 24, 1778: John Paul Jones achieved the honor
of being the first officer of the American Navy
to compel a regular British man-of-war to strike
her colors to the new flag.</p>

<p class="p2">June 14, 1777: First strictly American flag decreed
by Congress. This flag displaced the British
Union by thirteen stars, and the making of the
first flag of this design is accredited to Betsy
Ross of Philadelphia. It contained thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white, and thirteen
white stars upon a blue field.</p>

<p class="p2">June 14, 1777: Captain John Paul Jones appointed to
the command of the Ranger. It was Jones who
first displayed the Stars and Stripes on a naval
vessel. It was also he who had previously first
hoisted "the flag of America" on board the naval
vessel Alfred in 1775.</p>

<p class="p2">June 28, 1778: First appearance on a foreign strong-hold
at Nassau, Bahama Islands. The Americans
captured Fort Nassau from the British, and
promptly raised the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p class="p2">August 3, 1777: First display of the Stars and Stripes
on land was over Fort Stanwix, New York.</p>

<p class="p2">August 10, 1831: The name "Old Glory" given to
our national flag by Captain William Driver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the brig Charles Doggert. The flag was presented
to the captain and contained one hundred
and ten yards of bunting. It is said to be now in
the Essex Institute, at Salem, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="p2">September 11, 1777: The American flag first carried
in battle at the Brandywine. This was the first
great battle fought after its adoption by the
Continental Congress.</p>

<p class="p2">September 13, 1784: The Stars and Stripes first displayed
in China by Captain John Green, of the
ship Empress, in Canton River. The natives
said it was as beautiful as a flower, and the
Chinese continued to call it the "flower flag"
for many years.</p>

<p class="p2">September 30, <a name="September" id="September"></a> 1787&ndash;August 10, 1790: The American
flag completed its first trip around the world,
borne by the ship Columbia, sailing from Boston.</p>

<p class="p2">October 18, 1867: First official display of the American
flag in Alaska. On this day, at Sitka, the
capital, the Russian flag was hauled down and
the American flag run up before the barracks
and in the presence of both Russian and American
troops.</p>

<h3>THE FLAG IN THE DARKNESS</h3>

<h4>BENJAMIN HARRISON</h4>

<p>I was never so profoundly touched with the beauty
of our flag as at night time in one of our immense
political demonstrations. One of the features of the
occasion was the sending upward of a mighty stream
of electric light which, piercing the darkness of the
night, reached a large flag which had been carried on
cords a thousand feet from the earth. The scene was
too impressive for me to describe. I can only say that
it did seem as though the flag of our country was
waving from the very battlements of heaven....
God pity the American citizen who does not love the
flag; who does not see in it the story of our great, free
institutions, and the hope of the home as well as
the Nation.</p>

<h3>WHAT THE FLAG STANDS FOR</h3>
<h4>HENRY CABOT LODGE</h4>

<p>The flag stands for all that we hold dear&mdash;freedom,
democracy, government of the people, by the people,
and for the people. These are the great principles for
which the flag stands, and when that democracy and
that freedom and that government of the people are
in danger, then it is our duty to defend the flag which
stands for them all, and in order to defend the flag
and keep it soaring as it soars here to-day, undimmed,
unsullied, victorious over the years, we must be ready
to defend it, and like the men of '76 and '61, pledge
to it our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.</p>

<h3>YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR FLAG</h3>

<h4>EDWARD EVERETT HALE</h4>

<p>"If you are ever tempted to say a word or to do
a thing that shall put a bar between you and your
country, pray God in His mercy to take you that
instant home to His own heaven. Stick by your family,
boy; forget you have a self, while you do everything
for them. Think of your home, boy; write and
send, and talk about it. Let it be nearer and nearer
to your thoughts, the farther you have to travel from
it; and rush back to it when you are free. And for
your country, boy,"&mdash;and the words rattled in his
throat,&mdash;"and for that flag,"&mdash;and he pointed to
the ship,&mdash;"never dream a dream but of serving her
as she bids you, though the service carry you through
a thousand hells. No matter what happens to you,
no matter who flatters you or who abuses you, never
look to another flag, never let a night pass but you
pray God to bless that flag. Remember, boy, that
behind all these men you have to do with, behind
officers, and government, and people even, there is
the Country Herself, your Country, and that you
belong to Her as you belong to your own mother.
Stand by Her, boy, as you would stand by your
mother."</p>

<h3>MAKERS OF THE FLAG</h3>

<h4>FRANKLIN K. LANE</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[A portion of an address delivered by the Secretary of the
Interior to the employees of the Department of the Interior,
on Flag Day, 1914.]</p></div>

<p>This morning as I passed into the Land Office,
The Flag dropped me a most cordial salutation, and
from its rippling folds I heard it say: "Good-morning
Mr. Flag Maker."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Old Glory," I said, "aren't
you mistaken? I am not the President of the United
States, nor a member of Congress, nor even a general
in the army. I am only a Government clerk."</p>

<p>"I greet you again, Mr. Flag Maker," replied the
gay voice; "I know you well. You are the man who
worked in the swelter of yesterday straightening out
the tangle of that farmer's homestead in Idaho, or
perhaps you found the mistake in that Indian contract
in Oklahoma, or helped to clear that patent for the
hopeful inventor in New York, or pushed the opening
of that new ditch in Colorado, or made that mine
in Illinois more safe, or brought relief to the old soldier
in Wyoming. No matter; whichever one of these
beneficient individuals you may happen to be, I give
you greeting, Mr. Flag Maker."</p>

<p>I was about to pass on, when The Flag stopped me
with these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday the President spoke a word that made
happier the future of ten million peons in Mexico; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that act looms no larger on the flag than the struggle
which the boy in Georgia is making to win the Corn
Club prize this summer.</p>

<p>"Yesterday the Congress spoke a word which will
open the door of Alaska; but a mother in Michigan
worked from sunrise until far into the night, to give
her boy an education. She, too, is making the flag.</p>

<p>"Yesterday we made a new law to prevent financial
panics, and yesterday, maybe, a school teacher in
Ohio taught his first letters to a boy who will one day
write a song that will give cheer to the millions of our
race. We are all making the flag."</p>

<p>"But," I said impatiently, "these people were only
working!"</p>

<p>Then came a great shout from The Flag:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The work that we do is the making of the flag.</p>

<p>"I am not the flag; not at all. I am nothing more
than its shadow.</p>

<p>"I am whatever you make me, nothing more.</p>

<p>"I am your belief in yourself, your dream of what
a People may become.</p>

<p>"I live a changing life, a life of moods and passions,
of heart breaks and tired muscles.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I am strong with pride, when workmen
do an honest piece of work, fitting the rails together
truly.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I droop, for then purpose has gone
from me, and cynically I play the coward.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I am loud, garish, and full of that ego
that blasts judgment.</p>

<p>"But always, I am all that you hope to be, and
have the courage to try for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am song and fear, struggle and panic, and ennobling
hope.</p>

<p>"I am the day's work of the weakest man, and the
largest dream of the most daring.</p>

<p>"I am the Constitution and the courts, statutes and
the statute makers, soldier and dreadnaught, drayman
and street sweep, cook, counselor, and clerk.</p>

<p>"I am the battle of yesterday, and the mistake of
to-morrow.</p>

<p>"I am the mystery of the men who do without
knowing why.</p>

<p>"I am the clutch of an idea, and the reasoned purpose
of resolution.</p>

<p>"I am no more than what you believe me to be,
and I am all that you believe I can be.</p>

<p>"I am what you make me, nothing more.</p>

<p>"I swing before your eyes as a bright gleam of color,
a symbol of yourself, the pictured suggestion of that
big thing which makes this nation. My stars and my
stripes are your dream and your labors. They are
bright with cheer, brilliant with courage, firm with
faith, because you have made them so out of your
hearts. For you are the makers of the flag and it is
well that you glory in the making."</p>

<h3>OUR HISTORY AND OUR FLAG<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<h4>WILLIAM BACKUS GUITTEAU</h4>

<p>Love of country is a sentiment common to all peoples
and ages; but no land has ever been dearer to its
people than our own America. No nation has a history
more inspiring, no country has institutions more
deserving of patriotic love. Turning the pages of our
nation's history, the young citizen sees Columbus,
serene in the faith of his dream; the Mayflower, bearing
the lofty soul of the Puritan; Washington girding
on his holy sword; Lincoln, striking the shackles from
the helpless slave; the constitution, organizing the
farthest west with north and south and east into one
great Republic; the tremendous energy of free life
trained in free schools, utilizing our immense natural
resources, increasing the nation's wealth with the
aid of advancing science, multiplying fertile fields
and noble workshops, and busy schools and happy
homes.</p>

<p>This is the history for which our flag stands; and
when the young citizen salutes the flag, he should
think of the great ideals which it represents. The
flag stands for democracy, for liberty under the law;
it stands for heroic courage and self-reliance, for
equality of opportunity, for self-sacrifice and the
cause of humanity; it stands for free public education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and for peace among all nations. When you salute
the flag, you should resolve that your own life will be
dedicated to these ideals. You should remember that
he is the truest American patriot who understands
the meaning of our nation's ideals, and who pledges
his own life to their realization.</p>

<h3>THE FLAG OF OUR COUNTRY</h3>

<h4>ROBERT C. WINTHROP</h4>

<p>There is the national flag. He must be cold indeed
who can look upon its folds, rippling in the breeze,
without pride of country. If he be in a foreign land,
the flag is companionship and country itself, with all
its endearments. Its highest beauty is in what it
symbolizes. It is because it represents all, that all
gaze at it with delight and reverence.</p>

<p>It is a piece of bunting lifted in the air; but it
speaks sublimely, and every part has a voice. Its
stripes of alternate red and white proclaim the original
union of thirteen States to maintain the Declaration
of Independence. Its stars of white on a field
of blue proclaim that union of States constituting our
national constellation, which receives a new star with
every new State. The two together signify union past
and present.</p>

<p>The very colors have a language which was officially
recognized by our fathers. White is for purity,
red for valor, blue for justice; and altogether, bunting,
stripes, stars, and colors blazing in the sky, make
the flag of our country to be cherished by all our
hearts, to be upheld by all our hands.</p>
